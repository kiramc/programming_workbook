- returns [1, 2, 3] but does not modify the caller, 
- automatically calls to_s

2. ! means "not" and ? asks "if"
  1. != means is NOT equal to, test whether something is not equal to something else
  2. putting ! before something turns it into a reverse boolean
  3. putting ! after something changes it if its a new method
      (like .uniq vs. .uniq!, it just depends on the method)
  4. putting ? before something does nothing, unless ? :
  5. putting ? after something only affects it if it's already 
      part of the method
  6. putting !! before something turns it into a boolean
